Foundation Degree Science in Computing.

This is the code for a simple competition app that takes surnames and scores.
It output the winners along with their percentages.
It also prints a list of entrants and their scores with percentages, seperating people who met a threshold score from
those who did not.

The following is the brief for the assignment:

Design a program that allows the user to enter ten surnames of competition entrants and the score reached by each entrant. 
The user should also enter the threshold score to be achieved by each entrant. The program should output the entrant names, 
the scores achieved in the competition and the percentage of the total score achieved by each entrant. The output should 
also announce the overall winner of the competition.
